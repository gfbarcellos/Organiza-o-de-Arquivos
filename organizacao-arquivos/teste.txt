I suppose the NFL gets away with that shit because it's hard to burn down a stadium.                                                                                                             19/10/2019

1185676234975514625Hey @NFL, if you keep fining players for speaking demonstrably truthful facts about your refs, nobody is going to believe anything you say moving forward. Fix the problem, not your players.                                                                                           19/10/2019

1185680244742639616@AdamSchefter NFL players arent slaves. They are American, so they also have freedom of speech.

1185680248370651136@AdamSchefter Maybe the NFL should start setting fines for refs that make the wrong calls.                                                                                                                                                                                              19/10/2019

1185680257988337666@PaolaDiCaro @scleriroma @cptharlock81 Nella NFL, a ogni official review, l'arbitro motiva la sua scelta col microfono. In NBA, invece, le spiegano ai coach.

1185680504445472768@DraftNetworkLLC If Herbert was willing to run, I take him. But he's not willing to run due to risk of injury, which would damage his draft stock. So right now in this game, gotta take Eason. In the NFL draft, I take Herbert.                                                       19/10/2019

1185683629483139078@MrBill11 Weird part is they have plenty of talent. I don’t know who half the players are but then #8 who I’ve never seen before looks like an NFL player making a big catch. They got 8-4 9-3 talent at least.

1185683732025479168@BrownsHuddle @ClayMatthews52 I think their are two issues here. One)unprecedented camera angles. We see it all. Two) an obsession by the nfl to protect players which affects refs ability to referee the game within the confines of traditional football. Aka big hits on qbs and una19/10/2019

1185683870471069696@nfl The storyline for the 2019 season continues to be the refs inability to make the accurate and correct calls week in and week out.

1185684032643833857@AdamSchefter So the @NFL and @nflcommish fined a player for speaking the truth? Not surprised. It's the same league who drug tested Eric Reid every week just LOOKING for a reason to get rid of him. And calls it "random."League doesn't like people who speak out. On anything.

1185702668423127040@ESPNMcGee Obviously! NFL could rectify that by allowing both teams a chance to play offense, no matter what. Why do they only get their chances if they only allow a field goal. It makes no sense.                                                                                    19/10/2019

1185702687171600391@AdamSchefter The fact that @ClayMatthews52 is absolutely right, and my media, ex-players, and retired officials are stating the same thing.

1185702802494054400@ladydog44 @NFLOfficiating @NFL This f king idiots, I think they’re protesting the PI challenge thing, they don’t like to review it, have you noticed how many their overturned, NONE. even when we all see it’s clear PI. That’s what I think                                          19/10/2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1185702836006522880@JesseJamesTweet @bschweit79_brad @BrownsHuddle @ClayMatthews52 @Reflog_18 @923TheFan Yea but fans protesting is still an indirect path into the NFL’s pockets.

1185702837541584902@GregTompsett 10 PPR points would shock me. I think the absolute hardest transition as an NFL player is when they are traded mid season and have to pick up a new offense, establish rapport and timing within the construct of the offense and then deliver in the offense.            19/10/2019

1185703278178381825College OT rules are so absurd (as are NFL OT rules.) Watching a 5 OT game is painful.  Thankfully, Mack Brown lost because he made at least 3 huge coaching mistakes just in OT.                                                                                                       19/10/2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1185703281617788928@ApplePasta @shawnpmcd I wouldn't leave a great college situation to coach in the NFL (see Nick Saban). But now that he's no longer coaching it may be a good opportunity for him somewhere. I'm not a fan but can't deny he's one helluva coach.                                       19/10/2019

1185728720402833408@WillBlackmon It seems like the NFL is so sensitive. I also feel like if someone like Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes said the same thing they wouldn't of gotten fined.

You still may be good enough to win the whole thing, given that Bama and Clemson both look beatable.                 19/10/2019

1185748793481924608@Landino103 @WVUfootball Glossy helmets are timeless. Looks professional like an NFL team or the paint job on a car.

Plus RG kicking true takes it to 35. Yet to even look at what Kittle and the RBs do.

1186061780969082880why did #NFL make the onside kick unrecoverable? I know it had to do w/ safety. Yet better ways to allow teams a shot late in games include: force receiving team back 5 yards, no running starts & leave the 10 yard rule in place. Wouldn't that give kicking team a fighting chance? 20/10/2019NFL

1186061817530986496All this talk about a depleted Saints unit. I mean sure, but the Bears D was never going to have an easy day against this Saints o-line.

1186061817543626753@Jared_Prescott @DawgPoundNation Generally I’m on board with this. I’m glad we kept Hue as long as we did to signal to potential hires they had a shot to turn this around but I have seen nothing from Freddy that leads me to believe he is an NFL head coach.

1186061837327982592@JimTrotter_NFL Awful play calling there. Gordon had nothing going all game but you give it to him there. Even if he isnt in it was gunna be a rush to get the field goal in.

1186061854705102848@RealMikeWilbon Maybe less about the bears and more about Payton going 5 and 0 without drew brees and then losing cook and Kamara for today and Bridgewater and Murray doing what they did on offense. I put Payton as the 2nd best NFL coach behind belichick over the past 5 seasons. 20/10/2019

1186061878121906183@EvanRobertsWFAN The first overturn was bullshit. They had no angle that showed the ball NOT crossing the goal line. It was called a TD and should. It have been overturned. Also, how does the league not have two goal line cameras? The angle cameras do NOTHING. #nfl scum          20/10/2019nfl

1186071176080220160@JaysonHajdu You’d think a lot of this could be easily solved with central replay that can review and butt-in only when necessary, we’d never have to know it was reviewed unless it was wrong. If only the NFL had enough money to invest in something like this.                      20/10/2019

1186071209030455297Not an NFL fan and not a Cardinals fan, but people actually being angry about this is just weird to me.Maybe it's because I am not really in tune with fantasy football culture and haven't been for years now, but still.

1186071219310858240@rG_TitanUp @emily_proud @TDavenport_NFL The logic is you are not going to get it overturned. So why beat your ahead against the wall? And at that point in the game, you have no idea when or whether you may need those timeouts.                                                     20/10/2019

1186075027814453248Ok, here's the silver lining. With the Broncos and Chargers loosing again, we are still in 2nd place in the division, 1 ½ game from 1st place, and we have a better win/lost in the division than these other 2. If we beat the Texans next week, we're in a Wild Card spot. https://t.c20/10/2019

1186075119975878657@dandakich Jackson is largely doing what I expect and what I expect is you can’t last long in the NFL as a QB running that much. If he can keep doing this for 3 or 4 years then I will consider myself wrong. But I’m guessing this ends much like RG3.                                20/10/2019

1186075146492305410@CEmma670 He is hot garbage. What an exposed failure he is. I do feel the NFL is fixed at every level. Kiss Goodell's ass and your team gets rewarded with calls from the refs. It is obvious just watch this past MNF game.                                                            20/10/2019

1187522722189975553@Cody_Dragon I mean not really and def not in any ways that as frequent or meaningful. The NBA isnt introducing role lock mid way through the season. And if they are implimenting changes like you cant hit QBs anymore in the NFL, they do it at the beginning of the season.         24/10/2019

1187526252246253569@BrycenNFL The offense isn’t. The defense is built for it but they just aren’t the best roster.. any top 5 team can be undefeated with that schedule. Don’t get me wrong they have a great chance but probably is a terrible way to put it in my opinion in a sport like the nfl        24/10/2019

1187530206552215552@IamFrozenGhost @youloveSliney @nyjets @bilalpowell29 This is just my opinion but in today’s NFL you need good play from QB, o line, CB, and edge.

Doesn’t bode well for even a wild card opportunity  24/10/2019

1187531024860712960The bad thing about Thursday night football on @NFLonFOX , is that @TroyAikman and @Buck call it. Which means they call two games a week. Can't stand either of them.

1187532283328122880@MattBarr_ so could u answer a question for me. Why does it seem like going out of bounds doesn’t stop the clock in nfl sometimes,like the game is on that player for Washington went out of bounds obviously yet they let last 3 seconds roll off clock what am I missing?

1187532284796243970@joelklatt to think all bowls aren't a success...they are!  This may call for a playoff extension....as well as making top 10 bowls your promotion darlings! Get with the NFL and make then almost as important as scouting combine...scout from every team there.

1187532961786351623@Shellsyeah81 @TroyAikman By stats. Diggs has highest fumbles by WR, doesn’t reflect his talent. Kirk’s played great, he’s not hottest in NFL IMO. I’ve been watching QB2 Bridgewater & Kyle Allen most though.

1187534634239705088.@GMC I get it that someone has convinced your advertising team that repetition is important in advertising.  But when I see the same tailgate commercial EVERY 10 Minutes or less during every @NFL broadcast, I really start to detest your brand.

Should I check my fantasy matchups during the games, or just drop a bowling ball on my nuts and pretend its Tuesday morning?                                      24/10/2019

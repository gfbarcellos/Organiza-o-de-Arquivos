Everyone from the live broadcast team to the national media agrees.So the League responds by fining the Browns for complaining instead of the refs for screwing up!??Something's broken @NFL. https://19/10/2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1185676100367724545Imagine having a job that fined you thousands of dollars for grumbling about auditors. I suppose the NFL gets away with that shit because it's hard to burn down a stadium.                                                                                                             19/10/2019

1185676234975514625Hey @NFL, if you keep fining players for speaking demonstrably truthful facts about your refs, nobody is going to believe anything you say moving forward. Fix the problem, not your players.                                                                                           19/10/2019

1185680244742639616@AdamSchefter NFL players arent slaves. They are American, so they also have freedom of speech. The NFL should be ashamed of themselves.                                                                                                                                                19/10/2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
1185680248370651136@AdamSchefter Maybe the NFL should start setting fines for refs that make the wrong calls.                                                                                                                                                                                              19/10/2019

1185680257988337666@PaolaDiCaro @scleriroma @cptharlock81 Nella NFL, a ogni official review, l'arbitro motiva la sua scelta col microfono. In NBA, invece, le spiegano ai coach.

1185680504445472768@DraftNetworkLLC If Herbert was willing to run, I take him. But he's not willing to run due to risk of injury, which would damage his draft stock. So right now in this game, gotta take Eason. In the NFL draft, I take Herbert.                                                       19/10/2019

1185683629483139078@MrBill11 Weird part is they have plenty of talent. I don’t know who half the players are but then #8 who I’ve never seen before looks like an NFL player making a big catch. They got 8-4 9-3 talent at least.

1185683732025479168@BrownsHuddle @ClayMatthews52 I think their are two issues here. One)unprecedented camera angles. We see it all. Two) an obsession by the nfl to protect players which affects refs ability to referee the game within the confines of traditional football. Aka big hits on qbs and una19/10/2019

1185683870471069696@nfl The storyline for the 2019 season continues to be the refs inability to make the accurate and correct calls week in and week out.

1185684032643833857@AdamSchefter So the @NFL and @nflcommish fined a player for speaking the truth? Not surprised. It's the same league who drug tested Eric Reid every week just LOOKING for a reason to get rid of him. And calls it "random."League doesn't like people who speak out. On anything.

Morey tweeted 7 words from his private Twitter acct. that were up for 15 minutes and a foreign govt tried to get him fired.  Not quite the same.

1185686073516662784@RapSheet So the @NFL espouses totalitarian principles like, "don't you dare criticize us" over a person's right to express their opinions and beliefs?!? That's just unAmerican! @bakermayfield                                                                                        19/10/2019

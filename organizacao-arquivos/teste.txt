1183560798364426241True story, I reactivated my ESPN+ account solely to watch the "new" NFL Prime Time. My favorite show on TV from 1980s until 2001..haven't watched for 18 years until today and it was like picking up an old baseball glove from your childhood (to mix sports metaphor). #NFLPrimetime13/10/2019NFLPrimetime

1183560809038913538I still have faith the Browns will improve. Young team. Lots of injuries. New system. QB that forces the ball but still looks more talented than 50 percent of the QBs in the NFL. Great running back. Plus it doesn’t hurt that the bengals, Steelers and ravens aren’t great.         13/10/2019

1183560825975390210@BenLeftCoast @RamsNFL Take a look at the cap next year, along with 19 FA.

1183560832824705024@TerezPaylor Can a sign and trade deal work in the NFL where Jacksonville signs Ramsey long-term including the bonus and then just has the dead cap money after the trade?

1183560899346489345The Dallas Cowboys are trying to be the first NFL team to start 3-0 and finish 3-13.                                                                                                                                                                                                    13/10/2019
1183560901569339392@keating_glen @DeeAndre__ I give the defense credit for this win streak right now and teddy had a great game last week, (against the worst D in the NFL).. haha well it’s sad you’ve wasted all your money going to games only to have zero understanding?                             13/10/2019
1183560905323212800@JArnoldTAMU85 @RaiderACE562 They have absolutely no presence here. No one cares about them. You could live here and not even know there is a second NFL team here. The Raiders, Steelers, 9ers and cowgirls all have larger canvases here and its not close.                           13/10/2019

1183560931982241792@TheKaspar_XV I lived there 79-91. Rams and Raiders were always in the shadow of Lakers and Dodgers. NFL game attendance at Anaheim and Coliseum was ok, but usually well repped by fans of visiting team. Tough NFL city. Only hometown football fav is USC, and they’re imploding.    13/10/2019

1183560984390262784@BravesNinja @NFL They over complicated the game. What was wrong with football form the 80’s? You add that to all the bs politics being involved and it is so unwatchable. CFB is sooooo much better.                                                                                   13/10/2019
1183560987124875266Thomas Davis still has it.
